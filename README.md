## Algorithmic Toolbox Programming Assignment 03: Divide-and-Conquer
### Problems
Apply the divide-and-conquer technique to solve various computational problems efficiently:
* [`/src/binary_search/BinarySearch.java`](src/binary_search/BinarySearch.java): Problem 1, Binary Search, implements the binary search algorithm (PASSED);
* [`/src/majority_element/MajorityElement.java`](src/majority_element/MajorityElement.java): Problem 2, Majority Element, checks whether an input sequence contains a majority element (PASSED);
* [`/src/sorting/Sorting.java`](src/sorting/Sorting.java): Problem 3, Sorting: 3-Way Partition, in the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm replaces a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition (PASSED);
* [`/src/inversions/Inversions.java`](src/inversions/Inversions.java): Advanced Problem 4, Number of Inversions, counts the number of inversions of a given sequence;
* [`/src/points_and_segments/PointsAndSegments.java`](src/points_and_segments/PointsAndSegments.java): Advanced Problem 5, Points and Segments, computes, for each point, the number of segments that contain this point.
